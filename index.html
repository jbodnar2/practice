            Interactive web map created by Georgia State University Library that
            invites researchers, students, and the public to visualize the
            extensive built environment and demographic changes that have
            occurred throughout our metropolitan region from the 1940s to the
            present. The project provides aerial imagery overlays of the five
            core metropolitan counties – Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb, Gwinnett, and
            Clayton – documenting over eight decades of growth and change in our
            region. Also included are census tract level population and housing
            data, providing additional context to these visualizations. Among
            the changing patterns revealed are the dramatic growth of the
            suburbs, decline in agricultural areas, decline and rebuilding of
            the urban core, and shifting racial and housing patterns.

            Tracing a History of Atlanta's Public Transit

          <p class="card__description">
            Atlanta, originally named Terminus, has a profound history which is
            extensively intertwined with transit. This project visualizes how
            the city's public transit system, now a shadow of what it once was,
            falls short of its far-reaching intentions. By highlighting the
            routes which have been proposed in the development of these systems,
            this project aims to contribute to larger discussions taking place
            around the topic of public transit in Atlanta. The displayed map
            layers were georeferenced from planning documents available through

            often served general planning purposes and therefore were not

            Krog Street Tunnel is one of Atlanta’s premier destinations for

          <p class="card__description">
            With more than 80,000 acres of tree cover inside the Perimeter,
            Atlanta leads the nation in urban tree cover; approximately 47% of
            the city has significant tree growth. Atlanta's forest is home to
            over 50 species of native trees, which work to reduce carbon
            dioxide, produce oxygen, conserve and filter water, serve as
            habitats for native and endemic species throughout the Piedmont
            region, cool neighborhoods, and serve as recreational areas. In a
            city where the tree canopy is already being lost, is submerged in
            its own wastewater, is experiencing extreme climate change,
            including enhanced heatwaves, and other factors documented here, the
            current threat of deforestation has placed the city’s trees in an
            historically critical situation. Launched 2022; last accessed

            Interactive web map created by Georgia State University Library that
            invites researchers, students, and the public to visualize the
            extensive built environment and demographic changes that have
            occurred throughout our metropolitan region from the 1940s to the
            present. The project provides aerial imagery overlays of the five
            core metropolitan counties – Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb, Gwinnett, and
            Clayton – documenting over eight decades of growth and change in our
            region. Also included are census tract level population and housing
            data, providing additional context to these visualizations. Among
            the changing patterns revealed are the dramatic growth of the
            suburbs, decline in agricultural areas, decline and rebuilding of
            the urban core, and shifting racial and housing patterns.
